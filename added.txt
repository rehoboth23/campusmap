I added three vertices:
Baker
South Fayerweather
Sarner

I updated the select start, select goal and draw paths to include the names of the start. goal amd nodes on the path

I changed the vertex class adding a v-type which based on a relation to its adjacents divides the routes into major and
minor routes(short roads) drawing main buildings in a different color from side entrances and main routes in a different color from side routes.
